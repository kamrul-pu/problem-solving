"""
Step 1: Initialize the distance to the source vertex as 0, and the distance to all other vertices as infinity.
Step 2: Relax all edges in the graph |V| â€“ 1 times, where |V| is the number of vertices in the graph.
For each edge (u, v) with weight w, check if the distance from the source vertex to v can be reduced
by going through u. If so, update the distance to v to the new, shorter distance.
Step 3: Check for negative weight cycles. If there is a negative weight cycle in the graph,
the algorithm will never converge and will keep reducing the distance to some vertices with each iteration.
To detect such cycles, repeat step 2 one more time. If any distance is updated in this extra iteration,
there must be a negative weight cycle in the graph.
Step 4: If there is no negative weight cycle, the shortest distance to each vertex from the source vertex has been found.
