"""
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n.
Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order,
but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
